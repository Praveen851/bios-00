# __Day-1 : BIOS-00 Bootcamp__

# Breakdown of the day



*  ## General introduction 


    To the daily routine and what's expected of us along with the objective of the training program which is to instill the practices of clean coding and test(spec) driven development into ourselves almost like second nature.

<br>

* ## Coding cycles
    
    In this part, a problem statement was shared  with us and we were instructed to write the code for it by following the etiguettes list shared. After each code cycle, showcases were done in which the errors and missed ettiquettes as shared were discussed.

    The problem statement is as follow:
    >As a fan of geometry,
I want to model a line based on points consisting of (x, y) coordinates using the cartesian system,
So that I can calculate its length.

* ## Typing Drill

    Post Lunch we started with typing drills on Typeracer to enable us reacha minimum typing speed of 50 rpm.

* ## Coding Cycles

    Following the typing drills, we were made to do coding cycles in pairs with the same problem statement as before. 

* ## Feedback / Summary session

    We were asked to summarise what happened in the clas on te day and were asked our feedback regarding the same.

    ### _My feedback regading the same is:_
    
    * Setting up the environments took a lot of time. If the requirements were told in advance, it would have been better.

    * Being the first day, it was a bit difficult to  follow along the whole session.

## Other instructions and discussions

* We were instructed to use __Gradle__ instead of __Maven__ build tool for Java.

* We were asked to name the __README.md__ file in all upercase, it being the convention.

* We were told to use __JUnit__ for testing of the specs.

* The following was told to us regarding conventions.

    > Project Convention > Class Convention > Guidelines

* We were told that for __spec testing in Ruby, RSpec should be used.__

## Assignments
* Blogpost on any topic, not less than 500 words was to be written.
* Set up an automation script which will generate the gradle project, make some initial commits and generate a README file.
* Creation of Wiki for the day.
* Setup of the required tools.
